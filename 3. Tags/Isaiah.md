the isrealite people in 1-31- dont get brought back
and the judean people onward do get brought back

connection between: there are always steps to come back into the light, whether thats coming back to God or changing our ways to prevent global warming

how does ecological overshoot compare to the bygone faith of the judean people. Is it possible to recover from the overshoot of both.

How the actions of previous generations affect current and future generations.

In a nutshell ch1 is about how climate change is a symptom of a bigger problem of capitalism.
in a nutshell ch2 is about the different forms of reality as sarah sees them. Whether thats Reality or reality, and was slightly heretical in her use of out of context bible verses.
ch3 Worldviews not in alignment with Reality are pointless. Our individialistic, extractive, dualistic, hierarchical, reductionistic, abstract, self-referential, and short-term worldview has long failed those who have been crushed underneath its weight, and is now failing all of us.
