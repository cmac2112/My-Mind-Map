# Symbolic Constants

As defined in the [[C Book]]
It's bad practice to bury "magic numbers" like 300 and 20 into the program; they convey little information to someone who might read the program later
(# define) line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters
(# define name replacement text)

Therefore after any occurrence of name will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text.

Symbolic Constants are typically written in UPPER CASE format

(# define UPPER 300)
