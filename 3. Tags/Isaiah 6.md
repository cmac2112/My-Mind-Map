# Isaiah 6

Isaiah sees the Lord on his throne,

5: "woe is me for i am undone! Because i am a man of unclean lips, and i dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts"

Angel flies to [[Isaiah]], and brings a hot coal to allow Isaiah to talk for God

7: And he touched my mouth with it, and said:
	"Behold this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged"
Later god goes on to tell Isaiah that [[jeruseleum]] shall be burned or chopped down, and the stump of the 'tree' will become the new seed of the Holy Spirit
