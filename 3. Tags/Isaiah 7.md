# Isaiah 7
set during the time when the kings of [[isreal]] and [[Syria]] join forces to remove [[Ahaz]] from the throne of [[Judah]]
Isaiah sent to king [[Ahaz]]

in the days of [[Ahaz]] son of [[Uzziah]], and some of his other companions went to [[jeruseleum]] to make war against it

They knew [[assyria]] was going to attack from the east and that [[Ahaz]] was loyal to [[assyria]]. They wanted to defeat [[Ahaz]] before [[assyria]] attacks

God told [[Isaiah]] to go out and meet [[Ahaz]] with his son [[Shear-Jashub]] at the end of the aqueduct and to say to him 'Take heed, and be quiet; do not fear or be fainthearted for these two stubs of smoking firebands, for the fierce anger of [[Rezin]] and [[Syria]] and the son of [[Remaliah]]' because they have plotted evil against [[Judah]]

Basically dont be afraid, because of the prophecy given below

in verse 7 the Lord says:
"it shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is [[Rezin]]. Within 65 years [[Ephraim]] will be broken, so that it will not be a people. The head of [[Ephiraim]] is [[Samaria]], and the head of [[Samaria]] is [[Remaliah]]'s son. If you will not believe, Surely you shall not be established"

Isaiah gives another prophecy anyway after [[Ahaz]] refused to ask for a sign to prove that it was God. [[Isaiah(Character)]] told [[Ahaz]] about a virgin who will bear a son named Immanuel "[[Jesus]]"?

Before the newborn child knows right from wrong, the lands of [[isreal]] and [[Syria]] will be deserted because of the [[assyria]] invasion.

In the end it is prophesized that [[judah]] will be overtaken by [[assyria]] and its leader shaven clean for humiliation 

There would not be enough people left to consume all of the milk from the animals that are there.
