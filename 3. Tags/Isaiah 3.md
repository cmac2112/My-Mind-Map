# Isaiah 3

Isaiah 3 1:15 shows the collapse of human leadership in contrast to the action of the Lord
16 ~ : shows how the divine judgement work out, transforming prosperity into poverty, and prepares for the vision of the Lord's next action.

In the first part God talks about what could happen during the ruling of man in a roundabout way

Verse 2: The mighty man and the man of war,
		The judge and the prophet,
			And the diviner and elder;
	3: The captain of fifty and the honorable man,
		The counselor and the skillful artisan,               -- assuming that the person in charge has all of these abilities --
			and the expert enchanter	

Human rulers may have all of these abilities that God is alluding too but:

Verse 6: When a man takes hold of his brother,
		In the house of his father, saying
			"You have clothing; You be our ruler, And let these ruins be under your power"
	7: In that day he will protest, saying, "i cannot cure your ills"
		For in my house is neither food nor clothing; Do not make me ruler of the people"
	8: For [[jeruseleum]] has stumbled, And [[judah]] has fallen,
		Because their tounge and their doings are against the Lord, 
			to provoke the eyes of His glory
	9: ... "they declare their sin as [[Sodom]]; They do not hide it ... For they have brought evil upon themselves"
Human rulers still cannot cure illness and save people like God can

After that, God talks about the Oppression and Luxury happening in Judah and condemning it 

16: Moreover the Lord says: "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty
	And walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, 
		Walking and mincing as they go, Making a jingling with their feet,
	17: Therefore the Lord will strike with a scab ... and the Lord will uncover their secret parts"
18: In that day the Lord will take away the finery:
		The jingling anklets, the scarves, and the crescents;
19: The pendants, the bracelets.... etc

God will punish the women who walk in luxury as they do, and take away everything from them, even the clothes on their backs. The women were not humble

Then again God alludes to the fall of Judah

25: Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.
