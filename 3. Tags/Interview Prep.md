cover letter template:

I am excited to apply for the software engineering position. As Bethel College’s first Computer Science graduate this December, I bring a blend of academic achievement, hands-on technical experience, and a passion for software development that aligns with your team’s vision.

During my tenure as a Front-End Software Engineer Intern at Leggett and Platt, I developed React components that transitioned internal workflows from spreadsheets to efficient digital tools. My contributions included adding multi-language support and in-platform communication features, ensuring usability across international branches. I have further honed my skills through projects like BCSocial, a Dockerized social media app that streamlines event communication for student organizations, and Solar Eye, a NASA Space Apps Award-winning solar system simulator leveraging Three.js and NASA APIs.

Beyond technical expertise, my leadership experience as the founder and president of the Bethel Software Society has taught me the value of mentoring and teamwork. Managing projects with SCRUM and deploying solutions with CI/CD pipelines are integral parts of my approach, ensuring timely delivery of impactful applications.

I am eager to bring my dedication to innovation and continuous learning to Visa. Could we schedule a time to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your team’s needs?

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your organization.
