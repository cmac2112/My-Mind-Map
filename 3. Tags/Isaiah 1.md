# Isaiah 1

Isaiah 1 starts with [[Isaiah(Character)]] who is the son of [[Amoz]], having a vision concerning [[judah]] and [[jeruseleum]] in the days of [[Uzziah]], [[Jotham]], [[Ahaz]], and [[Hezekiah]], kings of [[judah]]

Verse 2 starts with the vision given to Isaiah about God's feelings towards the nation. "I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against me."

Later God goes on to continue ridiculing the nation of being sinful and the nation turning its back on the Lord. 

9: Unless the Lord of hosts had left us to a very small remenant, we would have become like [[Sodom]], we would have been made like [[Gomorrah]].

Starting on verse 11 God begins ridiculing the sacrifices made in his name to appease him. He wants them to not bring any more futile sacrifices as the people bringing them are full of sin, or they are bringing them acting as if it were a chore rather than something to help build good relationships with the God.

He asks them to repent and make themselves clean verse 18: "Come now, and let us reason together, Says the Lord, 'Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool."

Verse 20: But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword"

Verse 20 alludes to the pressing matters of the [[assyria]] nation on the doorstep of Judah and how God will let them be devoured by the nation if they are to rebel against his word.

Verse 21 onwards talks more about [[jeruseleum]] itself saying
21: How the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; Righteousness lodged in it, But now murderers.

Verse 21 talks about how good the city once was but has fallen into degeneracy

23: You princes (leaders) are rebellious, And companions of thieves; Everyone loves bribes, And follows after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, Nor does the cause of the widow come before them.

Verse 23 talks about how even the leadership of the city has become degenerate over time and how they take bribes and are friends of thieves.

Verse 25 onwards is God talking about how he will make this city righteous once again.

Isaiah 1 ends with verse 31 saying: The strong shall be as tinder, And the work of it as a spark; Both will burn together, And no one shall quench them

That last verse talks about how the city will become unstoppable in progress if it were to become righteous once again
