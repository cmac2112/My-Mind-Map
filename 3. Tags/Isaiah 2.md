# Isaiah 2


Isaiah 2 continues with the prophecies foreseen by Isaiah, starting on Verse 1 - 4 states that the future house of God will be a place that all nations flow to. Where people will beat their swords into plows, and their spears into pruning hooks, and no nation shall lift up a sword to one another.

Verse 5 onwards talks about the current situation [[judah]] is in with [[assyria]]. Either that have or they are thinking about allying with [[assyria]] so their nation can prosoper, but God and Isaiah ridicule that because [[assyria]] does not follow God.

Verse 8: Their land is also full of idols;
		They worship the work of their own hands,
			that which their own fingers have made.

Later on it talks about God's wrath coming again to shake the earth mightily
Verse 20: In that day a man will cast away his idols of silver,
			and his idols of gold,
				which they made, each for himself to worship,
					To the moles and the bats.
To end God or Isaiah says to
Verse 22: Sever yourselves from such a man,
			Whose breath is in his nostrils;
				For of what account is he?
Which means they need to sever ties with the people who worship things that they made with their own hands.
