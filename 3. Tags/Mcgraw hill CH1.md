# chapter 1

preface: [[IBM]]'s strategy to market and create computers reshaped the market in 1982

Previously before the [[IBM Personal Computer]], all other industry leaders such as [[Apple]], [[Commodore]], and [[Radio Shack]] all built unique hardware that would only run their software

[[IBM]] created its computers to be a standard, so that all new software products were encouraged to follow the new standard to create new programs

Chapter 1:

Computers beneath the surface are run by a set of rules in a [[Programming Language]],  which is then broken down in a [[Compiler]] into [[Machine Language]].

[[Vacumm Tubes]] were less efficient before transistors came around as they had to be heated to keep electrons 

Chapter 1 is mostly talking about the history of computing

[[Alan Turing]] published a clear and profound theory of the nature of general-purpose computing scheme. The machine was completely hypothetical of 'remarkable' simplicity. This drew the attention of other talented people.

[[Fortran]] was the first widely used [[high-level language]], which included many elements of [[Algebraic Notation]], It was the most widely used at the time because [[IBM]] had the most computers in the world to run it.

Other Languages around this time made their appearance:
[[COBOL]], for business oriented data-processing
[[ALGOL]], first widely accepted language in the international community
[[PL/I]], also developed by IBM and introduced in 1965 as a single language capable of satisfying the needs of scientific, commercial, and system programming

A significant idea of the time was the development of an [[Operating System]]
By 1966 almost all medium to large computers ran under some sort of [[Operating System]]
Jobs were submitted to the computer through [[Punch Cards]], either to the computer room or by remote job entry terminals.

[[Teleprocessing]] came to the scene where these computers could handle 50-100 people using it at a time to complete tasks simultaneously

Continues to talk about how old old old computers work

Old [[CPU]]s contained [[Main Storage]], [[Routing circuts]], and the [[Arithmetic-logic Unit (ALU)]].

1. Storage: [[Main Storage]]
2. Data Flow: The switching networks that provide paths for routing information from one part of the computer to another
3. Transformation: The circuits used for [[Arithmetic]] and other data manipulation. This function is usually concentrated in a single [[Arithmetic-logic Unit (ALU)]]. The centralization provides economy (speed) since a single set of fast expensive circuits is used in time sequence for all operations. Transformation circuits operate on information obtained from storage by control of dataflow switching. As will be seen later, many of the more complex transformations such as subtraction, multiplication, and division can be obtained economically by control of sequences of very elementary operations such as addition, shifting, etc..
4. Control: This is the general term that includes the important function of performing time sequences of routings of information through the data flow. The control function appears on many levels in a computer. Usually the control is organized as a set of time sequences, or [[Clock Cycles]]. Each cycle period is commonly divided into equally spaced time units called [[Clock Intervals]]. The term cycle refers to a specific type of sequence for selections on the data flow performed in a succession of clock intervals. For example: there is an instruction fetch cycle during which an instruction containing information about a transformation is brought from storage to an [[Arithmetic-logic Unit (ALU)]] [[Register]]
