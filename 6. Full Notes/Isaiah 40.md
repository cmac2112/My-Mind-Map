# Isaiah 40

Isaiah 40 begins [[Isaiah(Character)]]'s message to the future people of [[judah]] during their exile in Babylonia

1: "Comfort, yes, comfort My people! Says your God."
This is God's message to his people to not be discouraged in their faith or journey in life given their present challenges.

2: "Speak comfort to [[jeruseleum]], and cry out to her, That her Warfare has ended... For she has received from the Lord's hand, Double for all her sins."
This lets the people of jeruseleum know that their sins have been paid for and no more harm shall come from these previous sins.

Then verse 3 and 4 talks about how they must prepare for the Lord's return by clearing the 'road'

6: The Voice said, "Cry out", And he said, "What shall i cry?"
"All flesh is grass,
And all its loveliness is like the flower of the field,
7: The grass withers, and the flower fades, 
Because the breath of the Lord blows upon it;
Surely the people are grass.
8: The grass withers, the flower fades,
But the word of our God stands forever."

This passage talks about the human race being fragile creatures in the eyes of God. "All flesh is grass" grass is often not thought of as strong plants. 

"And all of its loveliness is like the flower of the field" - There are good parts of the human race, and its loveliness is represented as flowers in the field

"The grass withers and the flower fades, Because the breath of the Lord blows upon it;"
Again displays the fragility of people because all it takes is one breath from the Lord for him to wipe out the entire field

"The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever" - The word of God will endure long past anyone's lives on earth
