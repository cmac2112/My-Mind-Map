# Isaiah 10

A prophecy foretold by [[Isaiah(Character)]]

Isaiah 10 continues [[Isaiah(Character)]]s prophetic narrative that explores the themes of Gods judgement against unjust rulers, his use of the [[assyria]]n empire as an instrument of divine anger, and the hope of restoration for a righteous remnant. This chapter presents an intricate display of divine justice, omnipotence, and mercy. -- bible hub

begins with the describing of either the wrath of God or his mercy in coming back to them alluded in [[Isaiah 9]]

Verse 1: woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, who write misfortune, which they have perscribed. -- lawmen who make laws that exempt them from some service or taxes

3: What will you do in the day of punishment, and in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory? 4: Without Me they shall bow down among the prisoners, And they shall fall among the slain" For all this His anger is not turned away, But his hand is stretched out still.

Stretched out still has different translations in different versions, tough to tell if stretched out is like a helping hand to help those who may repent and turn back to God, or his hand is stretched out wreaking havoc on the land.

verse 5 continues on to talk about the judgement of [[assyria]] as well which God is using as a tool to judge  

After that starting on verse 30 it talks about the new [[isreal]] born from the ashes of the holy fire that would burn it down

20: And it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of [[isreal]], and such have escaped the house of [[Jacob]], Will never again depend on him who defeated them, But will depend on the Lord, the holy one of isreal, in truth

21: The remnant will return, the remnant of [[Jacob]], to The Mighty God. -- the small remnant leftover will turn away from all sin and only to God in the end

34: He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, And [[Lebanon]] will fall by the Mighty one

Alludes to God striking down the proud like cutting a forest, leads into [[Isaiah 11]] where a 'branch' of a righteous man grows from the stumps of the roots of [[Jesse]] King David's father

This is talked about in chapters on how the savior will save isreal and bring all nations together in Gods new kingdom on earth as it is in heaven but we convinently seem to skip the parts that conincide with the [[Jesus]] story
