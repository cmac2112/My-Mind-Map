# Isaiah 42


Isaiah 42 begins with a decree from God saying;
1: "Behold! My Servant whom i uphold, My Elect One in whom My soul delights!
I have put my Spirit upon Him;
He will bring forth justice to the Gentiles."

Once again this is a prophecy of Jesus, Several times in this book there have been prophecies like this, such as in the beginning chapters where isiaiah gave a similar prophecy talking to the king telling him a savior will be born of a virgin. There are very very very very very few places in the bible and in the world where people are born of virgins. More specifically only one place.

"he will bring forth justice for truth."

6: "I, the Lord, have called You in righteousness, And will hold your hand; I will keep you and give you as a covenant to the people, as a light to the gentiles."

'give you as a covenant to the people' refers to the new covenant in the new testament
