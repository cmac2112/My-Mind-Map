# Ajax
stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML
asynchronously communicate with a server and update a webpage once the response is received, without reloading the whole webpage. An asynchronous request occurs when the web application sends a request to the server and continues running without waiting for the server response. Although the "x" in Ajax stands for "XML", Ajax is used to transmit plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON.
