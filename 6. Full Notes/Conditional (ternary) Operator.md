# Conditional (ternary) Operator


The conditional operator allows developers to write concise and conditional statements. The conditional operator (or ternary operator) has three operands separated by a question mark (?) and colon (:) If the condition evaluates to true then the value of expression 1 is returned, otherwise the value of expression2 is returned

condition ? expression1 : expression2
