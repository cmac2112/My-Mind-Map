# Isaiah 31

# The folly of not trusting God
This chapter starts off by saying
1: Woe to those who go down to [[Egypt]] for help, and rely on horses, who trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but who do not look to the Holy One of [[isreal]], Nor seek the Lord

Seems like Judah allies with [[Egypt]] during this time of strife

3: The Egyptians are men and not God; And their horses are flesh and not spirit. When the Lord stretches out His hand, Both he who helps will fall, And he who is helped will fall down; They all will perish together

Anyone who helps the Egyptians will fall along side of them when God's wrath comes. You cannot turn to the Egyptians to save you because their horses are many, but they are flesh just like every other human and not God. Only God can save the people of [[judah]]

4: ... The Lord of hosts will come down to fight for Mount Zion and for its hill. 5: Like birds flying about, So will the Lord of hosts defend [[jeruseleum]]. Defending, he will also deliver it; Passing over, He will preserve it.

The Lord will fight for [[jeruseleum]] and for those who repent and follow him instead of their own desires

8: [[assyria]] shall fall by a sword not of man....
- Reference to 2nd kings: 19:35 where God fulfilled this promise
