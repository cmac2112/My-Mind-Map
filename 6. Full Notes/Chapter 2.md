# Reality Systems of Life

cultural norm of self interest: I need not share with anyone, whether i am alive or dead; what is best for me is what is best.

Sarah was instructed of another way of seeing - pay attention then give thanks - mindfulness? 

what sarah observes: - definitly communist
1. humans are not at the center - there is no center but rather interconnected overlapping nodes
2. There is somewhat flexible balance
3. we live in an environment of mutual dependence
4. the system is a closed system, energy cannot be transferred in or out

Applying extractive logic (taking more to make more money rather than taking what we need) undermines the climate change initiative
