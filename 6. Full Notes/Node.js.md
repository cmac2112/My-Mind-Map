- [[Node.js]] allows developers to write [[JavaScript]] on the server and client, simplifying development tasks
- [[Node.js]] provides a simple mechanism to create and distribute modules. A [[Node.js]] [[module]] is a [[JavaScript]] file that provides some useful functionality
- [[Node.js]] works seamlessly with [[MongoDB]], a document database that stores [[JSON]] and uses [[JavaScript]] as a query language.
