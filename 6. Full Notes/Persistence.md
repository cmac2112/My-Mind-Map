[[operating systems]]

- Os must provide mechanism to store data for longer than the life of the process
- In system memory is volatile memory and can be easily lost (loss of power, crash, etc.)
- Hardware comes in many formes
- OS must abstract the hardware to programs, protect persistence and optimize performance

Abstraction - files directories links  
Protection  
Ensure correctness in cases of failure  
Ensure security of persisted data

- optimize  
    Disks are slow, must optimize to increase performance
