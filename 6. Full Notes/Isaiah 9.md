The Promise of Salvation  
Leadership and Governance  
Peace and Prosperity

# Government of the promised son:

Verse 6: For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

Each reference to His, or Son, Child is capitalized - reference to [[Jesus]]


# Continued Judgement and prophecy for judah turning away from God

Verse 12: The Syrians [[assyria]] before and the [[Philistines]] behind, they shall devour [[isreal]] with an open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, But His hand is stretched out still.

Verse 13: For the people who do not turn to Him who strikes them, Nor do they seek the Lord of hosts. 14 Therefore the Lord will cut off the head and tail from [[isreal]]

Elder and honorable is the head
prophet who tells lies is the tail
