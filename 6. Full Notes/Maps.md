# Maps


A map or associative array is a data structure that maps keys to values. Each key/value pair in a map is called an element.

JavaScript objects can be used as maps, in which the key is the object property and the value is the property's value. When an object is used as a map, individual elements are accessed by key using brackets. Ex: `myMap["key"]`.

### For-in loop

The for-in loop iterates over an object's properties in arbitrary order and is ideal for looping through an object map's elements. The for-in loop declares a variable on the left side of the `in` keyword and an object on the right. In each iteration, the variable is assigned with each of the object's properties.
