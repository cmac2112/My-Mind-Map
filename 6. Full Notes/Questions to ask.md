# Questions to ask

possibly 1
1. Trent voth gave an argument in my class a couple weeks ago along the lines of "If we had the capability to mine resources on asteroids cheaper than what we currently do on earth Would we?" 
I thought it was a great question but with a horrifically dumb response because for some reason our class came to the conclusion that we would rather continue extorting the laborer's and land in countries near and far than mine cheaper minerals without extortion. Because that is always what we have done.

I hope some of my classmates make an effort to take one of our excellent macroecomic classes soon because if someome puts something cheaper on the market this drives prices down and demand up for the cheaper product increasing GDP, Personally i see mining objects in space as a win win in this senario.
```
My question is, if we had the technology to cheaply mine asteroids and comets and sell it at a cheaper price to prevent human and land extortion, would we? 
```

simple answer is yes, if she says anything else then she is clinically insane. 



2. If there were less people on the earth would this be an issue. 
we are using more resources because we are beyond the carrying capacity, the population will flatten out soon whether through starvation or something similar.

3. If capitalism is the problem, then what other form of society is the solution

if she is using an iphone
4. why are you still using an iphone if you are so against capitalism and against the exploitation of resources. Lithium is hard to mine and is often done in other countries on the backs of a lower class of people.

5. You talk about how capitalism is so bad and causing issues in the world, but creating this book you had to actively participate in capitalism. I bought this book off of amazon which is a big carbon polluter in the world. Are any proceeds or profit from this book being donated somewhere to offset the carbon and trees used to create this?

6. to me it seemed like your solution to climate change was to live in a web of interdependence similar to how Native Americans lived. While i can see the benefits of this, society is too complex for this to be possible. In modern times is this not just called communism or socialism?
8. If we live in a web of interdependence, wouldn't the quality of life index for every developed country go down making lives of those who worked hard for their life lose out on what they worked so hard for?

9. Would there be any incentive for technological and scientific growth in an interdependent society?
