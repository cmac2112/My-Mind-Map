# Club Project Ideas

# 1. Mini social media for Bethel
An excellent way to learn the ins and outs of full stack development and user authorization.

Requirements
- Users can login with their bethelks email and ONLY their bethelks account (Google OAuth) and create an account
- profile dashboard
- home feed shows all posts of all people from bethel, no outsiders should exist on the platform and are sorted by earliest first, similar to Twitter's following tab
- Must be able to monitor and manage bad language and punish accounts who cannot follow rules - IMPORTANT
- Users should be able to upload images to their profile picture, post things to the main page.
- disable accounts that graduate from bethel

React, Node, MySQL,

break down into epics -> user stories -> tasks
generate mockups
