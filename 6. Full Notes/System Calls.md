How can we ensure user process cant harm others?
- What if a process wishes to perform some kind of restricted operation such as
- - issuing a I/O request to disk
- - Gaining access to more system resources such as cpu or memory
- Solution: privilege ….

System call

- Allow the kernel (os level unrestricted mode) to carefully expose certain key pieces of functionality to a user program such as
- 1. Accessing the file system
- 2. Create and destroying processes
- 3. Communicating with other processes
- 4. Allocating more memory

System call - trap  
Os boot: initializes trap table  
Os run (kernel mode): Create entry for process list allocate memory for program load program into memory setup …

1. Traps: A trap is an interrupt generated by the CPU when a user-level program attempts to execute a privileged instruction or encounters an error. When a trap occurs, the CPU transfers control to the kernel and executes a trap handler. The trap handler checks the type of trap and takes appropriate action, such as terminating the program or performing a privileged operation on behalf of the program.

System Calls
A system Call is a request made by a user-level program to the [[Operating System]] to perform a privileged operation such as reading from or writing to a file or allocating memory. To make a system call, the program executes a special instruction that triggers a software interrupt. The [[Operating System]] then transfers control to the [[Kernal]] and executes a system call handler. the system call handler checks the type of a system call and takes appropriate action, such as reading from a file or allocating [[Memory]].
