Difference between GUI and Web Design


Gui:

Devices:
			User hardware variations are limited. User Hardware characteristics are well defined. Screens appear exactly as defined.
			
User Focus:
			Data and applications
			
Data/information:
			Typically created and used by known and trusted sources. Properties generally known. Typically placed into a system by users or known people and organizations. Typically organized in a meaninful fashion. A notion of private and shared data exists.
			
User Tasks:
			Install, configure, personalize, start, use, and upgrade programs. Open, use and close data file. Fairly long times spent within an application. Familiarity with applications often achieved.
			
User's Conceptual Space:
			Controlled and constrained by the program.
Presentation Elements:
			Windows, menus, controls, data, toolbars, messages, etc. Many transient, dynamically appearing and disappearing. Presented as specified by designer. Generally standardized by toolkits and style guides.
			
Navigation:
			Through menus, lists, trees, dialogs, wizards. Not a strong and visible concept. Constrained by desined. Generally standardized by toolkits and style guides
			
Context:
			Enables maintaining a better sense of context. Restricted navigation paths. Multiple viewable windows.
Interaction:
			Interactions such as clicking menu choices, pressing buttons, selecting list choices, and cut/copy/paste occur within context of active programs.
			
Web:
		Devices:
			User hardware variations enormous. Screen appearance influenced by hardware being used.
			
User Focus:
		Information and Navigation
Data/information:
		Full of unknown content. Source not always trusted. Often not placed on the web by users or organizations. Highly variable organization. Privacy is often suspect.
		
User Tasks:
			Link to a site, browse or read pages, fill our forms, register for services, participate in transactions, download, and save things. Movement between pages and sites are very rapid. Familiarity with many sites not established.
			
User's Conceptual Space:
			Infinite and generally unorganized
			
Presentation Elements:
			Two components: browser and page. Within page, and combination of text, images, audio, video, and animation, May not be presented as specified by the designer - dependent on the browser, monitor, and user specifications. Little standardization
			
Navigation:
			Through links, bookmarks, and typed [[URL]]'s Significant and highly visible concept. Few constraints, frequently causing a lost "sense of place." Few standards. Typically part of a page design, fostering lack of consistency
Context:
		Poorer maintenance of a sense of context. Single page entities. Unlimited navigation paths. Contextual clues become limited or are difficult to find.
Interaction:
		Basic interaction is a single click. This can cause extreme changes in context, which may not be noticed
