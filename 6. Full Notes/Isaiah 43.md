# Isaiah 43

Verse 1 and 2 has God talking about his place in their lives and how he created them. He will always be with them

2: when you pass through the waters, I will be with you. And through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, Nor shall the flame scorch you.

God is reminding his people that he is their savior

Later on God talks about reuniting all of the people of [[isreal]] from the east, west, south, and north. "Let all the nations be gathered together, And let the people be assembled"

12: "I have declared and saved, I have proclaimed, And there was no foreign God among you; Therefore you are my Witness"

After that, God pleads with [[isreal]] who is becoming more unfaithful by:
23: "You have not brought me the sheep for your burnt offerings, Nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with grain offerings, Nor wearied you with incense."

It seems like the people of isreal are not offering sacrifices or worshiping God as they once had, similar to the people of [[judah]], but the people of judah did it but not enthusiastically.

28: Therefore I will profance the princes of the sanctuary; I will give [[Jacob]] to the curse, And Isreal to reproaches
