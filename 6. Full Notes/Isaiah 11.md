# Isaiah 11


Isaiah 11 seems to prophesize a righteous leader emerging and bringing [[isreal]] together strong again. This leader comes from someone named [[Jesse]] who is king [[David]]s father

2: The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and might, The spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord
3: His delight is in the fear of the Lord, and he shall not judge by the sight of his eyes, nor decide by the hearing of his ears;
4: but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; He shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.

11: It shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set His hand again the second time, To recover the remnant of His people who are left, From [[assyria]] and [[Egypt]], From [[Pathros]] and [[Cush]], From [[Elam]] and [[Shinar]], From [[Hamath]] and the islands of the sea.

Jesus will bring all those who have been taken from the land and bring them to a new kingdom where the righteous will reside and the wicked will be cast aside.
