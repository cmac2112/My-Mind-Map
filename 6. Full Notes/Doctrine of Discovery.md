The **Doctrine of Discovery** is a principle originating from the 15th-century Catholic Church. [It proclaimed that Christian nations had the right to claim lands inhabited by non-Christians, under the pretext of spreading Christianity](https://www.worldhistory.org/Doctrine_of_Discovery/)[1](https://www.worldhistory.org/Doctrine_of_Discovery/)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_doctrine). [This doctrine was later used to justify European colonialism and the seizure of indigenous lands](https://www.worldhistory.org/Doctrine_of_Discovery/)[1](https://www.worldhistory.org/Doctrine_of_Discovery/)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_doctrine).
