# isaiah 56


To start Isaiah 56, the Lord says, "keep justice, and do righteousness, For my salvation is about to come, and my righteousness revealed."

This can allude to a couple of different things, but i believe this still coincides with the savior that is talked about all throughout this chapter.

Later, it goes on to talk about foreigners who may not believe in God, and to not let them say that the Lord has separated the foreigners from their own people, and that the sons of the foreigner who join themselves with the Lord, will be brought into the Lord's "holy mountian" and will make them joyful in his house.

The second part of this chapter talks about Isreal's leaders and begins with a stark contrast to the first part. In this part it calls the leaders dumb and tells the beasts of the fields, which in this case are probably other nations and peoples to come and take them

"All you beasts of the field, come to devour, All you beasts in the forest."

His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant;
they area all dumb dogs,
they cannot bark;
...
Yes they are greedy dogs
which never have enough
And they are shepherds
who cannot understand;
they all look to their own way,
every one for his own gain,
from his own territory

"come" one says, "i will bring wine and we will fill ourselves with intoxicating drink;
Tomorrow will be as today,
And much more abundant"

What is happening here is a look into the lives of the leaders who may have brought [[isreal]] down the path it had. Their cushy lives without regard to the people (shepherds who dont understand) and selfish (they all look to their own way, every one for his own gain).
